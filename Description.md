# SVGo: Programming Pictures with Go

The workshop will start with SVGo examples, explore the API, take time sketching, and finally work through an example connecting SVGo with external APIs.

It’s useful for students exploring programming and other subjects to get immediate feedback, and the concept of “sketching” – trying out concepts and tweaking examples is a powerful tool for learning and exploring. This workshop will use a browser-based tool, svgplay (think of the Go Playground, but with pictures displayed next to your code) to teach graphics and visualization concepts (generative art, color, repetition, shapes, relationships, layout, typography), using short Go programs (25-60 lines of code).

Examples for the workshop are available for further study and exploration.

The last section will explore the Read-Parse-Draw pattern where the attendees are walked through an example of connecting to the NYT Top Stories API, and build a clickable information display.
